# It's Just Wood! v1.1.0

> Ever get frustrated that you can't fuel a fire with that stack of nice, fine wood you have in your inventory? Wonder why ancient bark can't make coal? Worry no more!

**Shout-out to Github user @shudnal** for providing a big update for Mistlands wood

Convert uncommon wood types to regular wood. Use all wood types to fuel fires and the charcoal kiln.
